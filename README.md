# Udacity_Landing_page_Question_collapsible

version 3 of code

I managed to make sections open on nav-link click and button click as well.

But sometimes, especially if I open the console, the code stops working.
I can successfully expand the sections, scroll into view.. and suddenly the buttons won't open. Or they open after several attempts or only when I try to open section by clicking the nav-link.

What is the issue? I don't see any in the console.
